attack_count,"The number of people being attacked appears to be increasing over time! This could be because of environmental factors like climate change and decreased food supplies pushing sharks closer to human-inhabited areas, or it also could be because of increased human interaction in the ocean (more boating, surfing, drilling, etc.). It is also possible people are just reporting more of these attacks with the rise of the internet in the 21st century! It would be interesting to further investigate the dip in attacks between 1938 and 1978!",,,,,
Victim.age,"The age of people being attacked appears to be increasing over time! Recently, the average age of those attacked appears to be around 34 years, while in the early 1900s, more attacks were occurring with people in their early 20s. ",,,,,
Provoked.unprovoked,"Unfortunately, unprovoked attacks seem to occur more than provoked attacks and both are increasing in frequency over time. This may be because the sharks are confused, curious (they have sensitive mouths for investigating things), territorial, or hungry. ",,,,,
Victim.gender,"If you are male, be careful around sharks! Throughout time, over each range of 50 years, greater than ~80% of attacks have occurred with male victims. ",,,,,
Victim.injury,"In good news, the proportion of fatal attacks over time appears to be decreasing! But, the proportion of injured victims looks to be increasing. This could be due to that uninjured encounters with sharks are less interesting to report. ",,,,,
Injury.severity,"While major lacerations in association with shark attacks are decreasing, minor lacerations have been increasing in proportion over time. It is interesting that less severe injuries like teeth marks, surface wounds, and abrasions appear to be much more rare for attacks. Less severe encounters may be reported less because they are not as concerning. ",,,,,
Site.category,"As for location, most of the attacks over time have also occurred in coastal areas, and the proportion of coastal attacks is increasing over time, while the proportion of the attacks further out to sea or inland is decreasing or stagnant. This could be because sharks might be moving closer and closer toward the coast, out of curiosity, for food, or climate reasons. It also could be because more people can interact with sharks around the coast. ",,,,,
Victim.activity,"Be careful surfboarding in Australia! Swimming appears to have been more dangerous in the past up until the 2000s when boarding seems more risky. Snorkeling, spearfishing, and diving are also slightly risky activities, as in recent decades, less than 30% of shark attacks are associated with these activities. It also should be noted that even standing in the water can be dangerous, with over 1% of shark attacks being attributed to standing in water every 50 years since the early 1900s. ",,,,,
