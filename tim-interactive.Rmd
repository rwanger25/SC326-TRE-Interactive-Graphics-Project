What Activities Put You at the Highest Risk of Shark Attacks?

### Takeaways

This page contains a bar chart visualizing the number of recorded shark attacks per water activity. Use the buttons on the sidebar to explore trends for different genders and age groups. Regardless of gender and age, most shark attack victims were swimming or boarding (surfing, paddleboarding, etc.) at the time of the incident. Be sure to stay alert when engaging in either of those activities. On the other hand, the activities with the least amount of shark attacks are those where you are barely in the water, if at all. These activities include fishing, boating, and standing in water. Males from ages 11-20 make up a large amount of victims. So watch your teens, parents!

When Should You Swim?

### Takeaways

This page highlights the number of shark attacks recorded by month of the year, and time of the day. You can use the button on the sidebar to switch between graphs. As one may expect, more shark attacks occur at times when more people are swimming. This is true for months of the year, where December through February, which are summer months in the southern hemisphere, have the most recorded incidents. Additionally, more attacks occur during the day than at night, with a sharp decline after 5:00 pm. By comparing the blue total lines with the other lines representing 50-year blocks, it is clear that both of these trends have remained consistent over time. Perhaps instead of going for an afternoon swim during the crowded summer months, try enjoying a cool, beautiful fall sunset on the beach.
